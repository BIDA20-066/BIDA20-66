<h2>History Of Rome</h2>
<p>Rome was founded in 753 B.C by Romulus and Remus ,twin sons of Mars,the God of war.
    They were condemded to death in river Tiber by Amulius after he imprisoned their mother, Rhea Silvia.
    The twins were luckly saved by a servant who instead of drowning them ,put them in a basket and pushed them down the river.
    They were safely carried to the area of the seven hills where the she-wolf Lupa nursed them in her lair in Palantine hill,till
    they were found by a sherpard and his wife and raised them as shepards.<br>

    Being natural born leaders, they fought off King Amelius and reinstated King Nimitar as King of Alboa Longa.<br>

    To make their own settlement Romulus built a wall around the Palantine Hill
